## Project Overview

This project involves the delineation of the Robinson Creek watershed and analysis of stream networks using ArcGIS Pro. Key tasks include:

- Clipping stream polylines to the watershed boundary.
- Selecting streams with order 5 or higher.
- Calculating stream lengths by stream order.
- Creating a detailed map of the watershed with streams styled by order and outlet location.

---

## Methods and Data

- Used ArcGIS Pro tools: Clip, Select by Attribute, Dissolve, and basic geoprocessing.
- Stream order information was derived from the `grid_code` attribute.
- Area and length calculations were performed using GIS spatial statistics.
- Final map created showing watershed boundary, streams with varying line thickness and color, and outlet.

## Results

- Watershed area: 324.55 sq. km (largest polygon).
- Stream lengths calculated for stream orders 5 through 9.
- Detailed map included in the project report (PDF).
